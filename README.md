# ECE 356 Project

In order to set up this project: 
Install MySQL from the following link: https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/windows/installer/8.0.html. Make sure to install the MySQL shell and the server, as you will need to set up your own database.

Install Python, and the 'mysql-connect-python' and 'pandas' modules. 

To download the CSVs used to load the database, the zip file can be found here: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1FaR_yg5ZzyMkJ0HbFcmVXKjU6j1fku4w?usp=sharing
